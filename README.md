LDSTorrents
===========

A web application that builds torrents for LDS videos and generates RSS feeds by category

Many LDS chapels in the U.S. have broadband internet access, but due to limited bandwidth and congestion their usefulness for streaming media is limited. This requires members to download the videos in advance onto their various devices which creates a support problem for technology specialists who are responsible for supporting all the different devices and conneting them to projectors and TVs.

The purpose of this library is to create a torrent feed of media files (specifically videos) based on media public published by the LDS Church on it's various websites. The feed can then be consumed by any bittorrent client and used to create a media library on the local LAN allowing clients to stream the media to clients connected to TVs (ex: raspberrypi, roku). This will reduce the support burden on technology specialists.

With the current version of this feed I was able to setup a RaspMBC build that would allow browsing and playing media files. I had it working on my LAN at home. For those interested I journaled evertyhing I did here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwdSWrESrHa-MNX14eYg5T-XtBz9M5vS-8zd9uvzYVs/edit?usp=sharing

The LDS Church has since talked with me about my efforts as well as one or two other similar efforts and they are investigating a solution. But anyone who's interested in an interim solution is welcome to contact me with questions about the project.
